# Greetings, fellow citizens of the planet!

Henlo, it's a me! Tolunay DÃ¼ndar! But you can call me Tolu (just like almost everybody) or Lulu!
I'm 22 and I madly love science, technology, video games, books (mostly sci-fi or biographic) and music (especially rock & metal \m/). In fact, [you know, I'm something of a musician myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_oTxsHK5d8). Joking aside, [I'm an amateur self-taught guitarist-ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jticyp_3V48&feature=youtu.be) and a freelance video game translator.

I study German Translation and Interpretation at Hacettepe University. As a matter of fact, I think I should say I was studying. Though officially I'm still a student, it's kind of like I dropped out of it in order to prepare for the uni exam again and change my major. I want to go after my dreams and deal with science or tech! Booya!

As I said, I'm preparing for uni exam but in the mean time I'm also trying to improve myself in CS via online sources.
