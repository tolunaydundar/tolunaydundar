Student / Translator & Localization Specialist
----------------------------------------------

Henlo, it's a me! Tolunay! But you can call me Tolu or Lulu! I'm 23 and I'm madly in love with science, technology, video games, books (mostly sci-fi and biographic) and music (especially rock and metal \\m/). In fact, [you know, I'm something of a musician myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_oTxsHK5d8). Joking aside, [I'm an amateur self-taught guitarist-ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jticyp_3V48&feature=youtu.be) and a freelance translator.

I studied German Translation and Interpretation at Hacettepe University. Well, kind of... I dropped out in order to change my major . At the moment I'm studying Physics at Dokuz Eylul University.
